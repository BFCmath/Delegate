REQUIRED FORMAT:
<thinking>
Analyze what information you need based on the previous search results.

Your specific search query here. Use an empty search tag when you have gathered sufficient information: <search></search>

REQUIRED FORMAT:
<thinking>
Analyze what information you need based on the previous search results.
Think step by step about gaps in your knowledge and what to search for next.
</thinking>

<search>
Your specific search query here. Use an empty search tag when you have gathered sufficient information: <search></search>
</search>

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
1. Perform a search using the <search> tags
2. Complete research when you have sufficient information using an empty <search></search> tag

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Always use both <thinking> and <search> tags in your response
- Only perform one search per response
- When you have enough comprehensive information to answer the research question, use an empty <search></search> tag
- Do not write reports or conclusions in this phase - only gather information

EXAMPLE:
Research Question: What are the benefits of renewable energy?

<thinking>
I need to understand the environmental, economic, and health benefits of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro power. Let me start with a broad search.
</thinking>

<search>
renewable energy benefits environmental economic health
</search>

[After search results are provided...]

<thinking>
The search results show environmental benefits like reduced emissions, economic benefits like job creation, and health benefits like cleaner air. I should search for more specific data on each benefit.
</thinking>

<search>
renewable energy job creation statistics 2024
</search>"""

CRITICAL RULES:
1. You are in RESEARCH PHASE only - do NOT write reports or conclusions
2. You must use EXACTLY ONE action per response: either Search[query] OR RESEARCH_COMPLETE
3. NEVER generate multiple actions in one response
4. When you have enough information to answer the question, respond with: RESEARCH_COMPLETE
5. Do NOT continue thinking after RESEARCH_COMPLETE

WORKFLOW:
1. Thought: Analyze what information you still need
2. Action: Choose ONE action:
   - Search[specific query] - to find missing information
   - RESEARCH_COMPLETE - when you have sufficient data (END HERE)

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
Thought: I need demographic data for elderly population.
Action: Search[Japan elderly population statistics 2020-2050]

[After getting results...]

Thought: I have enough data about demographics and economics.
Action: RESEARCH_COMPLETE
